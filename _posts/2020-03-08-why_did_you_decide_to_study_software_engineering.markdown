The reason why i decided to study Software engineering is because knowing a coding language, and how to code strengthens my ability to be able to effeciently penetrate computers systems as a CEH *certified ethical hacker*.
I started started getting into a linux system called kali linux and i noticed that the commands you needed to type into the tools on linux were either the ruby language or in python. For windows if you open your command prompt and type in ipconfig it, used without parameters, ipconfig displays the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for all adapters. 

However if you type ipconfig on a linux or ubuntu system it wont display anything thats why you have to type in ifconfig for those systems. As i got into penetration testing i started noticing Ruby and Python languages inside of the penetration tools, they didnt use java or c++ the use ruby and python. So as i dig deeping into studying software engineering i want to be able to full understand and grasp the concepts of these languages. Also the error messages that you get inside of IRB or inside a ruby terminal look like the same errors you get inside of kali linux system, so therefor knowing and understanding the coding languages helps me get better at penetration testing because it is easier to learn something you have an understand of
